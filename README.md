## Hi there 👋

I am Collins, a software engineer based in Nairobi, Kenya, and can overlap with US/EU hours.

I primarily work on backend stuff using NestJS, Express.js, and Node.js.

I write TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python.

I also do a bit of technical writing. I am published on Medium, Hashnode, and Geekflare.

I am currently building loosely-coupled event-driven NestJS microservices using Kafka, RabbitMQ, & gRPC.

😮‍💨 *Bear with me as I update the ReadMe files on the projects to better highlight them. However, I am open to discussing any projects on my profile.
I am also continuously working on NestJS microservices, and some projects will change as time goes by.*
